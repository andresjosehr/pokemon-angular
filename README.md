# Pokemon Practice

## Description

This is a practice for show the pokemons in an user interface with angular.

For some time I have been studying about rxjs and I was encouraged to develop this small application that uses the pokemon API. Its logic is simple: a single interface that obtains a list of pokemons and shows them to the user, which in turn implements an infinite scroll function and a search engine that brings pokemons according to the matches written in the search engine
